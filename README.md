# Sign Language Recognition with MediaPipe and TensorFlow

This project implements real-time sign language recognition using the MediaPipe library for hand and pose detection, along with TensorFlow for building and training a deep learning model.

## Overview

Sign language recognition is an essential tool for facilitating communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project aims to provide a robust and real-time solution for recognizing sign language gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

### Key Features

- Real-time detection and recognition of sign language gestures using a webcam.
- Data collection tool for recording sign language gestures and expanding the recognition capabilities.
- Training pipeline for building and fine-tuning the recognition model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
